# Disable features

Cake Wallet allows you to optionally disable features.

## Disable fiat API

Cake Wallet allows you to disable the fiat API lookup, which uses our servers.

You can disable this when creating a new wallet, or in Privacy settings.

## Disable exchange

Cake Wallet allows you to disable the cryptocurrency exchange feature, which uses third-party servers if opened.

You can disable this when creating a new wallet, or in Privacy settings.
