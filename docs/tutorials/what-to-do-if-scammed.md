We understand how devastating it can be to fall victim to a scam. It's unfortunate that there are individuals out there looking to exploit innocent users. 

This guide will provide you with instructions on what to do after being scammed, to help safeguard your funds now and in the future.

## Move any remaining funds immediately

If your wallet seed has only been recently compromised, it is possible that the scammers may not yet have been able to steal your funds. This is **even more likely** if your wallet is an XMR wallet; scammers will need time to wait for the wallet to synchronize.

If you recently lost control of your seed, and your wallet still shows a balance, you should follow these steps **IMMEDIATELY**.

1. Tap the menu at the top right, then select "Wallets".
2. Choose "Create New Wallet".
3. Select the relevant currency - Bitcoin, Litecoin or Monero.
4. Choose a wallet name (it can be any name). Then, select "Create Wallet". Make sure to save your new wallet's seed in a secure place.
5. After creating the wallet, tap the "Receive" button and copy the address.
6. Return to the "Wallets" screen, then return to the **compromised** wallet.
7. Tap the "Send" button.
8. Paste the address of your new wallet into the Address text box.
9. Press the "ALL" button next to the amount to send.
10. Tap on the large "Send" button near the bottom of the screen.

If you were able to successfully complete these steps, your funds should be safe for now!

## Stop using the compromised wallet

It is important to immediately stop using the compromised wallet.

Under no circumstances should you send any additional funds to the compromised wallet. Scammers may attempt to deceive you with promises of assistance or recovery, but remember that they are only trying to exploit you further.

## Create a new wallet

To continue using Cake Wallet safely, you'll need to create a new wallet.
You can follow the instructions [here] for a detailed tutorial. Otherwise: 

1. Tap the menu at the top right, then select "Wallets".
2. Choose "Create New Wallet".
3. Select the relevant currency.
4. Choose a wallet name (it can be any name). Then, select "Create Wallet". Make sure to save your new wallet's seed in a secure place.

## Delete the affected wallet

After creating a new wallet, we recommend deleting the compromised one, to make sure that you won't accidentally send funds to it again. To do so:

1. Tap the menu at the top right, then select "Wallets".
2. Find the compromised wallet in the list of wallets.
3. Swipe left on the compromised wallet.
4. Select "Delete".

## Report the scam

To contribute to the prevention of future scams and potentially aid in the investigation, it is important to make a formal report to the authorities.

If you are able, contact your local law enforcement agency and provide them with all the relevant details of the scam, including any communication you had with the scammers.

You can also report scam websites to us by contacting us at support@cakewallet.com. We will do our best to protect our users by filing abuse reports with domain providers to take down these fraudulent websites.

## Safeguard your seed

Please take extra precautions to safeguard your new wallet seed.
The best way to do this is to write it down on a piece of paper and store it in a secure location, such as a safe or lockbox. If these are unavailable, it's also generally safe to store it digitally as long as your devices are secure.

Never share your seed with anyone, including support staff. Remember that it controls your funds, and anyone who can see it has full control over your wallet. Stay safe!



## Verify who you are speaking to
