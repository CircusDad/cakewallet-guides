# Create backup

A Cake Wallet backup will copy over all wallets and settings to a fresh Cake Wallet installation. This new restore wallet can't have any existing wallets.

## Step 1

ALWAYS save the mnemonic seeds for all of your wallets just in case!

## Step 2

Create a backup file by clicking the hamburger menu in the upper right, then `Security and backup`, then `Create backup`.

## Step 3

You will be prompted for your PIN or biometic authentication. When provided, you will be provided a securely-generated backup password.

**SAVE THIS PASSWORD**

After saving the password, click `Export backup` and `Yes I have`. It will take a few moments to create the backup file, so don't panic if the screen freezes for up to a minute.

## Step 4

After the backup file is generated, you'll be prompted to share the backup file using the OS share function or save the file to your downloads folder. Choose your preferred location. You now have a backup file!
