Then above, paste the seed phrase (or keys), choose the "Seed language" for your wallet if you are restoring from the seed, and enter the blockheight from when you created the wallet. If you do not know the blockheight, please enter a date from a few days before you created the wallet. So, if it was created in February 2020 sometime, you could use January 31st, 2020 as the "Restore from date" input. After that, press the "Restore" button and leave your phone awake with the Cake Wallet app open, while your wallet completes synchronization.
