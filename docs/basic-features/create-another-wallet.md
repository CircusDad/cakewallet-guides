# Create another wallet

If you already have at least one wallet and want to make another (of the same asset or for a different asset), this is the guide for you!

## Step 1   

Go to the menu at the top-right. Tap on `Wallets`, then tap `Create New Wallet` at the bottom of your screen.

## Step 2  

Choose wallet type: Monero or Bitcoin (Electrum) and wait for your wallet to be created. We generate a wallet name automatically. On the next page, you will see your seed. Always remember to write down your seed phrase when you create a new Cake Wallet! This part is very important. The seed is the only way to recover your wallet. Please write down your seed on paper; not in a text file or on a WiFi-connected device. Once your seed is stored in a safe place, tap `Next` and you will be taken to your wallet's balance screen. Wait until the wallet is fully synchronized, and add some funds to your newly created Cake Wallet!
