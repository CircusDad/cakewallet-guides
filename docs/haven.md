# Haven

## Syncing

**The most common issue with Haven is an unsynchronized wallet.**

To perform most interactions with your wallet, your wallet must be fully synchronized. There will be a green dot at the top of your home screen.

If you are stuck on the same block while syncing for a while, or it says disconnected, you should [try another node](/docs/advanced-features/custom-node) or another internet connection.

If your wallet is not fully synced, your wallet balance may be incorrect, and you won't be able to send transactions. You will need to wait until your wallet is fully synced before proceeding. Keep the app open with the screen on to keep syncing.

## xAssets

Cake Wallet has full support for the common Haven xAssets like xUSD and the native XHV asset (previously HVN).

You can choose which asset you are sending in the Send screen. Click `Change currency`.
