## Why does Cake Pay need my email address?

We need a way to protect the gift card history and unused gift cards, and email serves as a convenient way to provide support.

## This is awesome, but why is only email needed?

Buying gift cards isn't regulated in the same way as using an exchange, so there are different requirements. Cake Pay is fully compliant with all guidelines and regulations.

Groupon has a simple checkout page that does not include the option for a gift code. To redeem a gift code, put your mouse cursor over your account name, and select "Redeem Gift Card" from the drop-down box.

This will add the gift card to your account as "Groupon Bucks." During checkout, you will see the gift card amount automatically deducted from your purchase total.
