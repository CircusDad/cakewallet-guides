## Why does Cake Pay need my email address?

Your email serves as a convenient way to provide support.

## Do I need to provide other information to third-parties to use my purchased products?

Depending on the merchant terms, you may need to provide other information to redeem and/or use your product. For example, you may need to provide information to the merchant for something to be shipped to your home.

## How can I bring up a code again?

Cake Pay Web redemption codes are only provided by email. Check your email to get the code.

## How do I recover an unused code?

You can recover an unused code by searching for it in your email.

## Why do I need to activate certain products on a different website?

Some products require you activate the item on another website because of various terms and agreements with these providers.

## What fees are there?

Cake Pay Web products are sold at face value. If you would like discounts for a selection of USA cards, check out Cake Pay Mobile.

## Why aren't Cake Pay Web products available in Cake Pay Mobile?

Cake Pay Web and Mobile are related but not exactly the same. They each communicate with different backends. We created Cake Pay Web to get these products available to everyone as quickly as possible, with the aim of incorporating these and better products to Cake Pay Mobile over time.

## Are there any limits?

Yes, there are limits. A single user can purchase a maximum of $10,000 per day. You may run into other limits, and limits are subject to change.

## Why is Cake Wallet showing a slightly different fiat value than the Cake Pay invoice amount?

Cake Wallet uses a different fiat API endpoint than the Cake Pay Web endpoint. This can lead to small (<1%) differences in prices shown. For non-USD denominated products, the spread may be a little larger because we buy the cards in USD, and there is thus an implied spread that Cake must pay between USD and the other fiat asset. Always make sure to send the exact amount of cryptocurrency specified for the invoice. Cake Pay uses extremely competitive market rates for crypto/USD.
