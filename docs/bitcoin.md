# Bitcoin

## Addresses

We automatically generate new Bitcoin addresses after each use for better privacy. Previous addresses continue to work.

## Seed format

We use the Electrum seed format. We don't currently support restoring Bitcoin wallets that were generated in another app, but you can restore your Cake Wallet Bitcoin mnemonic seed in the Bitcoin Electrum app.

## Bitcoin fee levels

We recommend leaving your Cake Wallet fee for Bitcoin as `Medium`.

| Cake Wallet name | estimatefee value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slow ~24hrs | 100 | Save on fees if you can wait a full day for the transaction to be confirmed. |
| Medium | 5 | The best blend of speed and cost. You'll usually get a confirmation within 3 blocks. |
| Fast | 1 | Aggressively pursues inclusion in the next block, usually overpaying. |
