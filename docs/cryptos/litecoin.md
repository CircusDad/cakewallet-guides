# Litecoin

{: .friendly}
Official Website: [litecoin.org](https://litecoin.org/){:target="_blank"}

## Addresses

We automatically generate new Litecoin addresses after each use for better privacy. Previous addresses continue to work.

BIP-39 seed type is generated by default, with an option to change to Electrum seed type in the `Advanced Settings` on the creation screen.

## Derivation Paths

Electrum: `m/0/x` (Segwit P2WPKH) <br> BIP-39: `m/84'/2'/0` (Segwit P2WPKH)

## Seed format

Litecoin wallets only currently support being created using the Electrum seed format. We support restoring seeds generated in the Electrum and BIP-39 seed format.

## MWEB

{: .friendly}
Intoduced in version 4.20.0

MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Block) is an addition to the Litecoin blockchain that runs parallel on an extension block, using the MimbleWimble protocol.

MWEB provides extra privacy through **Confidential Transactions**, **Stealth addresses**, and **CoinJoins**

### Scanning

In order to enable MWEB, tap "Enable" on the MWEB card prompt.
You will receive a notice about data usage, and the time it will take to download the needed data to use MWEB.

{: .note}
You will only need to download this data for MWEB once, regardless of how many Litecoin wallets you have.

The wallet will start downloading the needed header data, and show the MWEB balance card.
Once it's fully synchronized, you can tap the "Peg In" button to open the send screen and choose how much Litecoin to send into the MWEB network.

{: .note}
This is not required to do before sending to an MWEB wallet, but can be done to improve privacy by pre-emptively sending these funds into the MWEB network.

If you would like to disable MWEB synchronization or enable MWEB, switch the "Set MWEB always scanning" toggle under Menu -> MWEB settings.

### Receiving

In order to receive an MWEB transaction, you must give the sender your MWEB address, which can be found by switching the address type to MWEB by opening the `Receive` screen, tapping on the `Receive` text at the top, and switching the address type to `MWEB`. When you want to receive the transaction in the wallet, you must enable MWEB scanning.

### Sending

You can send Litecoin to an existing MWEB address (starts with `ltcmweb1`) using the same flow. No extra work is required to send to an MWEB address, the MWEB daemon will handle the transaction submission to the MWEB network.
