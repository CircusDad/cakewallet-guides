# Litecoin

{: .friendly}
Official Website: [litecoin.org](https://litecoin.org/){:target="_blank"}

## Addresses

We automatically generate new Litecoin addresses after each use for better privacy. Previous addresses continue to work.

We use the same derivation scheme as Electrum: `m/0/x` for receive addresses, and `m/1/x` for change addresses.

## Seed format

Litecoin wallets only currently support being created using the Electrum seed format. We support restoring seeds generated in the Electrum and BIP-39 seed format.
