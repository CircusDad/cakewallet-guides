# Litecoin

## Addresses

We automatically generate new Litecoin addresses after each use for better privacy. Previous addresses continue to work.

We use the same derivation scheme as Electrum: `m/0/x` for receive addresses, and `m/1/x` for change addresses.

## Seed format

We use the Electrum seed format. We support restoring seeds generated in the Electrum seed format, not the BIP39 format or other formats.
