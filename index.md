## General info

Cake Wallet is a non-custodial wallet. This means that all information about your wallet stores on your device, and you, the user, are 100% in control of your wallet and your funds. To fast and properly work your wallet should be always synchronized and you should see a "Synchronized" label on the top of the Main screen. The wallet has to scan the particular block the transaction was included in before it can display it in your wallet.  You need to leave the Cake Wallet app open with your Phone awake while your wallet rescans the blocks for transactions involving your wallet.
