### Linux installation guide

Cake Wallet runs on most linux devices. We make a compressed folder (tar.gz) and Flatpak available for download. You can also build the wallet using our instructions.

Example operating systems that are known to be working: Tails, Whonix, Ubuntu.

#### Specifying a custom Linux file save location

The default location for user save data (including wallets) is `~/Documents/cake_wallet`. This can be changed by running the following commands:

```
export CAKE_WALLET_DIR=[]
```
Replace `[]` with your preferred file location. Run Cake Wallet from the same command line.

### MacOS installation notes

Cake Wallet is available on both Apple Silicon (eg: M1/M2) and Intel Macs.
